## 7. Conclusion and Future Work

This systematic review explored the intersection of Quantum-Inspired Grey Wolf Optimization (QGWO), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for microgrid energy management. It synthesized a growing body of literature addressing optimization, adaptive control, and programmable energy systems. While each component—QGWO, RL, and SDN—has shown effectiveness in isolation, their integration remains limited in scope, scale, and deployment readiness.

The proposed QGWO-RL-SDN hybrid framework represents a novel, modular, and scalable solution for real-time energy management in smart microgrids. It leverages QGWO for global optimization, PPO-based RL for adaptive decision-making, and Ryu-based SDN for centralized network control. Deployed in a containerized environment (Mininet, Docker, Flask, and Google Colab), this system is engineered for reproducibility, flexibility, and real-time experimentation.

### Key Contributions

- **Taxonomic Review:** Categorized and compared over 30 studies on QGWO, RL, and SDN for energy systems.
- **Gap Identification:** Highlighted the lack of integrated, real-time, and scalable hybrid frameworks in the current state of the art.
- **Architecture Proposal:** Introduced a dockerized, multi-layered QGWO-RL-SDN microgrid management framework.
- **Research Trajectory:** Aligned the framework with future challenges in cost reduction, renewable integration, adaptive control, and intelligent scheduling.

### Future Work

The following directions will guide subsequent stages of this research:

1. **Algorithmic Enhancement**  
   Extend QGWO with neuro-fuzzy logic or hybrid metaheuristics for better adaptability and interpretability.

2. **Simulation-to-Real Transition**  
   Connect the Mininet-based environment with hardware-in-the-loop platforms or digital twins to validate performance in near-real conditions.

3. **Scalability and Robustness Testing**  
   Assess how the architecture performs under high DER counts, variable loads, communication failures, and cyber-physical attacks.

4. **Autonomous Policy Refinement**  
   Explore continual learning mechanisms for RL agents to self-improve using transfer learning or curriculum-based approaches.

5. **Open-Source Release and Community Evaluation**  
   Maintain a GitHub repository of the full framework, including Jupyter notebooks, Dockerfiles, and datasets for collaborative development and benchmarking.
