## Abstract

This systematic review investigates the integration of Quantum-Inspired Grey Wolf Optimization (QGWO), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Software Defined Networking (SDN) in microgrid energy management systems. By employing a structured PRISMA methodology, we explore adaptive frameworks for cost optimization, real-time control, and demand forecasting. The review identifies trends, limitations, and proposes a reference model for intelligent, SDN-based microgrid supervision and scheduling.

**Keywords**: QGWO, Reinforcement Learning, SDN, Microgrid, Adaptive Control, Energy Optimization, Smart Grid
