## 1. Introduction

### Background and Motivation

The global push toward sustainable energy and decentralized power systems has led to the emergence of microgrids—localized, intelligent power networks that integrate renewable energy sources with distributed control mechanisms. However, the dynamic and nonlinear nature of energy generation and consumption within microgrids poses significant challenges in real-time supervision, load balancing, cost optimization, and renewable scheduling.

To address these complexities, researchers are increasingly exploring AI-driven optimization frameworks that combine the exploration-exploitation strengths of metaheuristics with the learning capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). One promising approach is the **Quantum-Inspired Grey Wolf Optimization (QGWO)** algorithm, which enhances the classical GWO with quantum computation principles to improve convergence speed, solution diversity, and optimization robustness.

When integrated with **Software Defined Networking (SDN)**—a paradigm that decouples the control and data planes in communication networks—microgrid architectures gain programmability, centralized monitoring, and automated control. This synergy enables dynamic energy routing, intelligent forecasting, and adaptive grid response.

### Research Gap

Despite increasing interest in metaheuristic-AI hybrids, there remains a lack of systematic synthesis on how QGWO and RL can be practically integrated with SDN to manage microgrid operations in real time. Existing studies often treat these technologies in isolation, failing to explore their collective potential in a unified framework.

### Objectives of the Review

This review aims to bridge the gap by providing a comprehensive, systematic analysis of the state of research on QGWO-RL algorithms applied to SDN-based microgrid energy management. Specifically, we seek to:

- Identify current frameworks and models integrating QGWO, RL, and SDN.
- Examine their application to energy management tasks such as load balancing, cost minimization, and renewable scheduling.
- Evaluate technical trends, performance metrics, and common toolchains.
- Highlight existing limitations, research gaps, and future directions.
- Propose a reference architecture for real-time microgrid control using dockerized components and SDN telemetry.
