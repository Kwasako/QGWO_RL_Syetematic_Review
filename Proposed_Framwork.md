## 6. Proposed Framework

To address the identified gaps and capitalize on the synergy between optimization, learning, and programmable networking, this review proposes a novel architecture: an AI-Enhanced Quantum-Inspired Grey Wolf Optimization with Reinforcement Learning (QGWO-RL) framework for Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based microgrid energy management.

### 6.1 Architectural Overview

The proposed system consists of four tightly integrated layers:

1. **Optimization Layer**  
   Implements the Quantum-Inspired Grey Wolf Optimization (QGWO) algorithm to generate globally optimized energy schedules, considering cost, load balancing, and renewable input.

2. **Learning Layer**  
   Uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a deep reinforcement learning method, to adaptively dispatch and manage resources in real time based on system state feedback.

3. **Control and Communication Layer**  
   Powered by the Ryu SDN controller, this layer handles flow control, telemetry, and centralized network management of distributed energy resources (DERs).

4. **Emulation and Monitoring Layer**  
   Emulates the entire microgrid using Mininet, supports real-time control testing, and integrates dashboards (e.g., Grafana) for visualization and telemetry.

### 6.2 Workflow

The framework operates through the following sequence:

1. **Data Collection**  
   Smart meters and sensors capture real-time energy demand, generation, and system states. This data is forwarded via SDN-controlled paths to a Flask-based API gateway.

2. **Global Optimization (QGWO)**  
   Periodically, the QGWO algorithm computes optimal scheduling policies over a planning horizon (e.g., 24-hour forecast), considering renewable penetration, cost, and storage constraints.

3. **Policy Learning (RL Agent)**  
   The PPO-based RL agent interacts with the environment to refine dispatch actions using rewards based on multi-objective criteria (cost, load balance, stability, QoS).

4. **Control Execution (SDN Controller)**  
   The Ryu controller enforces control decisions by reprogramming switches and directing traffic or commands to actuators and DERs.

5. **Monitoring & Feedback**  
   System behavior is visualized using Grafana and logged for continuous learning and optimization.

### 6.3 Technical Stack

| Component | Technology |
|----------|-------------|
| Optimization | Python, NumPy, QGWO (custom or inherited from QML libraries) |
| Reinforcement Learning | PPO via `Stable-Baselines3` in Google Colab |
| SDN Controller | Ryu (Python-based), OpenFlow v1.3 |
| Emulation | Mininet (within Docker container) |
| Communication | Flask REST API |
| Visualization | Grafana, InfluxDB (optional), or custom dashboards |
| Deployment | Docker Compose, Ubuntu WSL, GitHub CI/CD |

### 6.4 Dockerized Microgrid System Layout

A modular, container-based deployment is proposed:

- **Container 1: Mininet**  
  Simulates the network topology with programmable switches and energy nodes.

- **Container 2: Ryu Controller**  
  Manages SDN flow rules, monitors traffic, and executes control commands.

- **Container 3: Flask API Server**  
  Receives telemetry, routes decisions between RL and QGWO layers.

- **Container 4: PPO RL Agent**  
  Learns dispatching strategies in interaction with system state feedback.

- **Container 5: QGWO Module**  
  Performs batch optimization, accessible via API or shared volume.

- **Container 6: Dashboard**  
  Displays energy flows, optimization performance, and system health.

This layered, scalable architecture not only enables reproducibility and modular experimentation but also serves as a testbed for hybrid AI solutions in energy management.
