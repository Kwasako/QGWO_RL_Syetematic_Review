## 2. Methodology

This section outlines the systematic review approach adopted to identify, screen, and synthesize relevant literature on the integration of Quantum-Inspired Grey Wolf Optimization (QGWO), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Software Defined Networking (SDN) in microgrid energy management. The review protocol was guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework.

### 2.1 Review Protocol

The PRISMA methodology was used to ensure transparency and reproducibility. A structured four-stage process—Identification, Screening, Eligibility, and Inclusion—was followed to filter relevant literature from a large initial pool of studies.

### 2.2 Search Strategy

Literature was retrieved from major scientific databases, including:

- IEEE Xplore  
- ScienceDirect (Elsevier)  
- SpringerLink  
- Scopus  
- MDPI  
- Google Scholar (for grey literature)

The following Boolean combinations were used in search queries:

("Quantum-Inspired Grey Wolf Optimization" OR "QGWO") AND
("Reinforcement Learning" OR "RL") AND
("Software Defined Networking" OR "SDN") AND
("Microgrid" OR "Energy Management")


### 2.3 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

| Criteria           | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inclusion          | Peer-reviewed articles from 2015 to 2025, in English, focused on QGWO, RL, SDN, and microgrid applications |
| Exclusion          | Non-peer-reviewed papers, studies not involving energy systems or SDN, unrelated optimization techniques |
| Grey Literature     | Included if it presented a novel methodology or architecture (e.g., arXiv, GitHub-linked papers) |

### 2.4 Screening Process

- **Phase 1**: Title and abstract screening to exclude irrelevant works.
- **Phase 2**: Full-text analysis to evaluate methodological rigor, scope alignment, and technical depth.
- **Phase 3**: Data extraction and classification by algorithm, domain, and architecture.

A PRISMA flow diagram (to be added in Appendix) will visually summarize the filtering process.

### 2.5 Data Extraction

The following data items were extracted for analysis:

- Authors and publication year  
- Targeted energy management objective (e.g., cost optimization, load forecasting)  
- Algorithm(s) used (QGWO, RL variant, etc.)  
- Simulation platform or testbed (e.g., Mininet, NS-3, Simulink)  
- Evaluation metrics (e.g., energy savings, latency, computation time)

### 2.6 Quality Assessment

Each study was evaluated using a modified Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for relevance, methodology transparency, and reproducibility. Priority was given to studies with open datasets or reproducible experiments.

### 2.7 Limitations of the Methodology

- Some relevant studies may have been missed due to keyword variability.
- Grey literature was selectively included based on perceived novelty, which may introduce bias.
- Non-English studies were not considered, limiting geographical diversity.
