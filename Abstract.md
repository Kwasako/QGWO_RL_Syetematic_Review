## Abstract

The increasing complexity of microgrid energy systems—driven by renewable integration, fluctuating demand, and real-time control requirements—demands intelligent, adaptive management solutions. This systematic review investigates the intersection of Quantum-Inspired Grey Wolf Optimization (QGWO), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Software Defined Networking (SDN) as a next-generation framework for smart microgrid energy management. Using the PRISMA methodology, we analyzed peer-reviewed literature from 2015 to 2025 across major scientific databases. We identified significant trends toward hybrid AI/metaheuristic frameworks, particularly those enhancing real-time decision-making through SDN's programmability and RL’s adaptive feedback learning. Key findings reveal growing research on QGWO variants in energy optimization, yet limited implementations in SDN-driven environments. We propose a reference architecture integrating Mininet, Ryu controller, and a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RL agent to support scalable, dockerized deployment for microgrid control. This review offers both a synthesis of current work and a forward-looking roadmap for researchers aiming to develop robust, intelligent microgrid systems.
